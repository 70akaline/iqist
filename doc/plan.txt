Interacting Quantum Impurity Solver Toolkit
===========================================

Future Works
============



A. Features
-----------

* try to implement ctqmc impurity solver for spin-boson system.

* try to implement ctqmc impurity solver for non-equilibrium dynamical
  mean field theory.

* try to implement new algorithm in existing ctqmc impurity solvers (for
  examples, Suwa-Todo algorithm, Lazy trace update, skip listing trick,
  PS good quantum number, etc.).

* redesign and rewrite the hibiscus code, a postprocess toolkit.

* design and implement python/C/C++ interfaces for iQIST.

* refine the measurement for two-particle quantities.

* implement the measurement for entangle entropy.

* refine the measurement for autocorrelation function/time.

* refine the measurement for orbital/spin correlation function.

* try to implement the PARQUET approximation (PA) code.

* try to extend the ctqmc impurity solver to zero temperature using
  projective algorithm.


B. Optimization
---------------

* try to test the Fortran co-array technique to accelerate the core codes.

* try to apply OpenMP to implement fine-grain parallelism.

C. Others
---------

* clean the source codes.

* make English user guide.

* design GUI for iQIST.

* create a test factory.
