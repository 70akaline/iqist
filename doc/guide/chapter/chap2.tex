\section{Compiling system}

In order to compile and install iQIST correctly, you should ensure the
following softwares are correctly installed and configured in your OS.

* Intel Fortran compiler
* MPICH2 or OpenMPI
* BLAS
* LAPACK
* Python 2.X
* scipy, numpy, and f2py

The downloaded iQIST software package is likely a compressed file with zip
or tar.gz suffix. The users should uncompress it at first. And then go to
the iqist/src/build directory, edit the make.sys file to configure the
compiling environment. Once the compiling environment is configured,
please run the make command in the top-level directory of iQIST. After a
few minutes (depending on the performance of compiling platform), the
iQIST is ready for you. Note that all of the executable programs will be
copied into the iqist/bin directory automatically. Please add this
directory into the system environment variable PATH.
